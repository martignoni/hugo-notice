## Installation

### As a Hugo module

1. Initialize your existing site as hugo module

    ```shell
    hugo mod init github.com/USERNAME/REPO
    ```

2. Add the `hugo-notice` as a hugo module to be able to get upstream changes later

    ```shell
    hugo mod get github.com/martignoni/hugo-notice
    ```

3. In your site's or theme's configuration file `hugo.yaml` or `hugo.toml`, add a new `module` section and define both `hugo-notice` and your currently used theme as modules to be imported.

    Example, with `hugo.yaml`:
    ```yaml
    module:
      imports:
        - path: github.com/martignoni/hugo-notice
        - path: my-theme
    ```
    or, with `hugo.toml`,
    ```toml
    [module]
      [[module.imports]]
        path = "github.com/martignoni/hugo-notice"
      [[module.imports]]
        path = "my-theme"
    ```

### As a Git submodule

1. Add the `hugo-notice` as a submodule to be able to get upstream changes later `git submodule add https://github.com/martignoni/hugo-notice.git themes/hugo-notice`

2. Add `hugo-notice` as the left-most element of the `theme` list variable in your site's or theme's configuration file `hugo.yaml` or `hugo.toml`.

   Example, with `hugo.yaml`:
    ```yaml
    theme: ["hugo-notice", "my-theme"]
    ```
    or, with `hugo.toml`,
    ```toml
    theme = ["hugo-notice", "my-theme"]
    ```
## Usage

In your site, use the shortcode, this way:
```go
{{< notice warning >}}
This is a warning notice. Be warned!
{{< /notice >}}
```
or
```go
{{< notice tip >}}
This is a very good tip.
{{< /notice >}}
```

### Enabling dark mode

We recommend that you use the standard [`prefers-color-scheme`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-color-scheme) CSS media feature to detect if a user has requested light or dark color themes. In this case, dark mode will work automatically. The `prefers-color-scheme` media feature is fully supported by all modern browsers.

Another way to make it work is to inject (e.g. via Javascript) the class `dark` into the `body` element of your pages when dark mode is needed.

### Changing icon set

Just copy the icons from one of the subfolders of folder `icons/` into folder `icons/`.

Any __solid__ SVG icons can be used. If you want to contribute your open licensed icons, your pull request is welcome.
